1) Parallel testing in SauceLabs
data-provider-thread-count="3" thread-count="3"

2) Seqencial testing for Appium local testing:
data-provider-thread-count="1" thread-count="1"
The data-provider-thread-count and thread-count should be 1 for Appium tests running in your local box.
This will force the sequencial test execution. Appium has a limitation allowing only one session
at the given time.

In general, it is recommended to set data-provider-thread-count and thread-count as 1 for
the local test execution.
